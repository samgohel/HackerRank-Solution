String Precedence Problem statement
#####

->Given a string, S, and an integer, K, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length K.

->Input Format
  The first line contains a string denoting S.
  The second line contains an integer denoting K.

->Constraints
  1 <= |S| <=1000
  consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).

->Output Format
  Return the respective lexicographically smallest and largest substrings as a single newline-separated string.

->Sample Input 
  welcometojava
  3

->Sample Output 
  ava
  wel

Explanation 
String S="welcometojava" has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length k=3:
We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).
The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
