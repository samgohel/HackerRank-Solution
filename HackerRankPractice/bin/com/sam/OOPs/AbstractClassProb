AbstractClass  Problem Statement 
#####

->A Java abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. That means you cannot create new instances of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses. You should learn about Java Inheritance before attempting this challenge.

->
abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}

->If you try to create an instance of this class like the following line you will get an error:
  Book new_novel=new Book(); 
  
->You have to create another class that extends the abstract class. Then you can create an instance of the new class.

->Notice that setTitle method is abstract too and has no body. That means you must implement the body of that method in the child class.
