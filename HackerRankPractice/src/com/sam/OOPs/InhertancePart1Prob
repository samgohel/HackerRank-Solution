InhertancePart1 Problem Statement 
#####

->Using inheritance, one class can acquire the properties of others. Consider the following Animal class:
class Animal{
    void walk(){
        System.out.println("I am walking");
    }
}

->This class has only one method, walk. Next, we want to create a Bird class that also has a fly method. We do this using extends keyword:
class Bird extends Animal {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("I am flying");
    }
}

->Finally, we can create a Bird object that can both fly and walk.
public class Solution{
   public static void main(String[] args){

      Bird bird = new Bird();
      bird.walk();
      bird.fly();
   }
}
