SubArray Problem Statement 
#####

->We define the following:
 -A subarray of an N-element array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements.
  Ex- array=[1,2,3], then the subarrays are [1],[2],[3],[1,2].[2,3] and [1,2,3].Something like [1,3], would not be a subarray as it's not a contiguous subsection of the original array.
   -The sum of an array is the total sum of its elements.
   -An array's sum is positive if the total sum of its elements is positive.
   -An array's sum is negative if the total sum of its elements is negative.
