->Given a string, S,matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens.We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters.Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

  A single string, S.
  
->Constraints
  1<= length of S <=4.10^5
  S  is composed of any of the following: English alphabetic letters, blank spaces, exclamation points (!), commas (,), question marks (?), periods (.), underscores (_), apostrophes ('), and at symbols (@).
  
->Output Format
  On the first line, print an integer, N, denoting the number of tokens in string S (they do not need to be unique). Next, print each of the N tokens on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string S.
