TagMatch Problem statement
#####

->Given a string of text in a tag-based language, parse this text and retrieve the contents enclosed within sequences of well-organized tags meeting the following criterion:
 -The name of the start and end tags must be same. The HTML code <h1>Hello World</h2> is not valid, because the text starts with an h1 tag and ends with a non-matching h2 tag.
  -Tags can be nested, but content between nested tags is considered not valid. For example, in <h1><a>contents</a>invalid</h1>, contents is valid but invalid is not valid.
  -Tags can consist of any printable characters.
