Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of A and B.
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B(i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.


Sample Input
hello
java

Sample Output
9
No
Hello Java

Explanation
String A is "hello" and B is "java".

A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4; the sum of their lengths is 9.
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore,  Ais not greater than B and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
